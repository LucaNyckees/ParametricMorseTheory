# ParametricMorseTheory

This repositery contains the code necessary to run simulations of a specific type of Morse theory approach, called *parametric Morse theory*. This is done in the context of a semester project under the supervision of Celia Hacker and Stefania Ebli,
in the **Laboratory for Topology and Neuroscience** at EPFL.
